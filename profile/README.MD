## Overview üåê

- **Decentralized Security**: Utilizing MPC, private keys are split into multiple shares and stored across different nodes, reducing the risk of single-point failures.
- **User-Friendly Authentication**: Integrate familiar social logins (WeChat/Alipay) with JWT to simplify wallet recovery and identity verification.
- **Multi-Chain Compatibility**: Supports various blockchains (e.g., Ethereum, Bitcoin, Solana, Polygon, TON) and is designed to accommodate both international and domestic (e.g., Shanghai Shutu Conflux) ecosystems.
- **Developer Empowerment**: Our comprehensive SDKs make it easy for developers to integrate wallet functionalities into DApps, promoting secure, multi-chain interactions.
